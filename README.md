# A toy logic solver

Since this is entirely a person project, and since I am a complete novice,
there is probably no reason for you to look at this repo.

The purpose of this repo is to implement my own logic solver. Eventually, I may
port this package Morloc to work as its type checker. To that end, my solver
will differ from normal ones in that generating interpretable error messages is
a priority.

I will start with a simple SAT solver. I may then move on to implementing
a more general SMT solver. As I go, I will play with case studies for solving
problems with a bias towards type systems.
